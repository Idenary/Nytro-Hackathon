# [$3000-$10000 NYZO] Nytro Hackathon: Implementation of an application that uses the Nytro token protocol

This is the repository that will be used to gather Idenary submission to Nyzo hackathon.

## About Idenary

Idenary is an informal team of artists and coders who assembled to bring fresh air and colors to crypto.  
We made a first contribution in a previous hackathon, that did not get the traction we hoped it would. Maybe this time is the right one!

## Our entry

First idea was to adapt our current Idenary.com website to enable Nyzo in addition of Idena.  
However since Nyzo does not support a login scheme yet, this seemed a poor timing, with little relation ship to the hackathon.

We had another idea in mind which would need more than just tokens, but NFT with properties.  
Since NFTs on Nytro have been announced and should be available soon, we decided to try our chance with a totally new concept.

Our contribution to the Nyzo Hackathon will be a completely new service and website, Nyzo centric.  
We will however maintain our colorful touch!

We forked the repo as required to be eligible to the hackathon and will post a description of our project as soon as the Nyzo NFT details are published and we made sure we can do it in that context.
