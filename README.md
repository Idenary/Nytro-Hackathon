## Bounty Description
[Project Nytro](https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/Project-Nytro) is a token protocol that brings ERC20-like tokens to the [Nyzo blockchain](). This with a 7 seconds block time, fast finality and very low fees. The main requirement and goal of this bounty is to use the Nytro token protocol in an open-sourced project. Build an app, website, game, ... that uses the Nytro protocol and get rewarded for your effort! All the documentation about the protocol, tokens and code samples needed to build with Nytro is available on the [Nytro github](https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/Project-Nytro). If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch on the [official Nyzo Discord](https://discord.gg/veYdkStw).

Sample code with a reference implementation written in Python can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/Project-Nytro/tree/main/implementations/tokens).

## About Nyzo
Nyzo is the first blockchain based upon the Proof-of-Diversity consensus mechanism. It's a democratic, fast, scalable and highly efficient blockchain which was founded in 2018. It was built by a team of anonymous core devs and turned into a fully community-driven project with the supporting development of the core devs. The Nyzo community maintains a fund that can be used to support work and development for Nyzo, which is controlled in a democratic way by network participants. All decisions are made on-chain by voting for Nyzo Community Fund Proposals (NCFPs). A [proposal](https://forum.nyzo.community/t/ncfp-21-nytro-hackathon/390) was made and funded to host a hackathon (which this bounty is part of) to boost the adoption of the Nytro Protocol.
